Unified reconstruction pipeline done in matlab.
Starting with mri recons, however could be expanded given that most of the steps to image reconstruction are universal. 

Core requirements are CHUNKING for memory sake
data ambiguity once loaded,
hopefully a translated headfile prior to startup
Could let data loader look at/modify header.


High over view is 
pull data   ( perhaps use simple puller )
run GUI
decide how much data to load
for each chunk
  load data
  recon chunk 
    refit to cartesian
    filter
    fft3d
  save out chunk (in complex and civmraw?)


ugly details
data pull step can/should make a headfile from the scanner headers
use that to make decisions about chunks/chunking. 
perhaps add a raw datasize once data has been pulled to this headfile?

loading code should understand chunks and know which chunk to load, 
  this code will have to be pretty smart, and may be unique to each scanner input.(maybe unique per scan sequence)


Utility Code:
Automatic code to find what variables are used in the headfile.
find_used_hfkeys.pl

Automatic code to find where a specified variable is used in the scripts.
find_hfkey_usage.pl

USAGE,
./find_used_hfkeys.pl

./find_hfkey_usage.pl U_civmid U_runno U_code ray_length
