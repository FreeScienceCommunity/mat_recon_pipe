there are options to skip the scanner -> civm header conversion step, and I've also added a
load arbitrary civm header function.
So, to summarize two new options,
  no_scanner_header - skips trying to load a header from the machine and
you have to provide all the necessary recon variables through options, or
  pre_defined_header loads a file from disk with lines of name=value, to
use this option you should add
'pre_defined_header=/path/to/some/file.kellyheader'. If you just specify
pre_defined_header it will look for manual.headfile in the data directory.
pre_defined_header still requires no_scanner_header to skip looking for
the scanner header\

These instructions were written to help a student with a different mri system, 
but the requirements are the same.

You must add the keyhole, keyhole_window options for this to work.


Other new option you may want is integrated_rolling(still requires badly
named skip_resort).

... It is really not fun to try and do this manually with
no_scanner_header, but here is my first pass. Part of my trouble is I
don't know what data I'm looking at when I try to recon.
This command manages to make images. But I think I did it wrong, I think
what I wanted was a 2D multi-echo or multi-volume recon.

Here is a 2d multi-echo recon command.... This could be 2D multi slice by
setting vol_type_detail to multi-volume and ne to 1. I don't know how to
handle the frequency correction slice in this case..., we might be able to
play with the loading parameters to 'skip' the frequency correction data.

This multi-echo recon is unclear what order echoes are in, if this is
really a multi-echo, it looks the echoes increase in length with time
starting before the peak(most signal).

I went back and generated a headfile to try the pre_defined_header option
here is the command, and it is attached.
rad_mat('civmaspect','A14129','010129',{'ignore_kspace_oversize','overwrite
',
'display_kspace','pre_defined_headfile','no_scanner_header','skip_resort'})
;
